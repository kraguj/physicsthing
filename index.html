      A framework for running physics simulations
    </div>

    <p>Our goal is to build a framework for running physics simulations with an emphasis on flexibility. Flexibility in two senses:

1. Being able to easily switch between different laws of physics: Newtonian Mechanics, Special Relativity, et cetera;

And,

2. Being able to use the simulation engine in different types of software. Our main interest is using it as a virtual lab for running experiments; However, we would also like to be used in making a computer game (e.g., flying a spaceship in a relativistic world.)

The project will be written entirely in Python.

=Current Status=

The physicsthing project is currently in its infancy. We have code that can simulate Classical Electromagentism/Special Relativity physics, soon to be uploaded; However, it was not made to be as flexible as we want physicsthing to be. Therefore, we will be coding physicsthing from scratch.

*_Serious Python coders are needed.

=Some Background=

The project was started by me, Ram Rachum, after about a year and a half of programming physics simulations. In my programming I would often try out different physical laws and different implementations of the same laws. However, I found that I had to do a lot of work just to get a very basic simulation running, and even then it wasn't too comfortable to work with. Every time I wanted to change something, I had to do a lot of coding.
That's the main motivation for this project.

Also, I believe there should be user-friendly simulation of Special Relativity, and especially a computer game. I think this would help people understand this sophisticated theory much more easily than by examining the math.
Imagine a computer game in which you fly a spaceship at relativistic speeds! You could circle around the sun for 30 seconds, and watch how the Earth has aged by years. You could engage in laser combat with a computer-controlled enemy spaceship, which is also able to go in relativistic velocities. This would redefine the genre of space shooters, giving rise to weird new strategies. And all of that while being based on actual proven physics. This is how it would really feel like to fly a spaceship in the real world!
